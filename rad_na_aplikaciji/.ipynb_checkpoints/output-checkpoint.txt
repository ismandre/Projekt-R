Do you know someone rich and famous Is he confident popular and Jowl all of 
the time e the epitome of mainstream success or on the other hand Is he 
stressed having second thoughts about his life choicest and unsure about the 
meaning of his liwfe7o I am wlmllming to be that It Ios the second one mainstream 
marketing and media have electively brainwashed our society Into accepting a 
false even potentially dangerous defioniotiaon of success Marketers want us to 
believe that having lots of money living len a big house and owning all of the Latest 
cars fashions and technology Is the key to happiness and hence success this 
overstated falsely advertised myth wis hardly ever the case min real life True success 
requires respect apprecimatmion1 mintegriwty1 and patience M ail of which are traits that 
by human nature are genuinely difficult to attain w especially in the face of modern 
marketers who relentlessly deceive us control our thoughts and usurp our 
Independence In order to Increase their bottom line
